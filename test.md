WebLogic Sample on Kubernetes with Shared Domain Home
=========================================
This sample extends the Oracle WebLogic developer install image by creating a sample WLS 12.2.1.3 domain and cluster to run in Kubernetes. The WebLogic domain consists of an Admininstrator Server and several Managed Servers running in a WebLogic cluster. All WebLogic servers share the same domain home which has been mapped to an external volume.

## Prerequisites
1. You need to have a Kubernetes cluster up and running with kubectl installed.
2. You have built oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3-developer image locally based on Dockerfile and scripts here: https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic/dockerfiles/12.2.1.3/
3. Username/password for the WebLogic domain are stored in k8s/secrets.yml which is encoded by base64. The default value is weblogic/weblogic1.  
If you want to customize it, first get the encoded data of your username/password via running
```
$ echo -n <username> | base64 
$ echo -n <password> | base64
```
Next upate k8s/secrets.yml with the new encoded data.

## How to Build and Run

### 1. Build the WebLogic Image for This Sample Domain
Pre-steps before build the image:
1. You need to download get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and save it to folder 'container-scripts'.
2. If you run `docker build` behind a proxy, you need to set up http and https proxy in the Dockerfile.

Then build the image:
```
$ docker build -t wls-installer .
```
Or you can build the image by running build.sh directly.

### 2. Prepare Volume Directories
Three volumes are defined in k8s/pv.yml which refer to three external directories. You can choose to use host paths or shared NFS directories. Please change the paths accordingly. The external directories need to be initially empty.

**NOTE:** The first two persistent volumes 'pv1' and 'pv2' will be used by WebLogic server pods. All processes in WebLogic server pods are running with UID 1000 and GID 1000 by default, so proper permissions need to be set to these two volume directories to make sure that UID 1000 or GID 1000 have permission to read and write the volume directories. The third persistent volume 'pv3' is reserved for later use. We assume that root user will be used to access this volume so no particular permission need to be set to the directory.  
 
### 3. Deploy All the Kubernetes Resources
```
$ kubectl create -f  k8s/secrets.yml 
$ kubectl create -f  k8s/pv.yml 
$ kubectl create -f  k8s/pvc.yml
$ kubectl create -f  k8s/wls-admin.yml
$ kubectl create -f  k8s/wls-stateful.yml
```
Or you can deploy all the resources by running deploy.sh directly.

### 4. Check Resources Deployed to Kubernetes
#### 4.1 Check Pods and Controllers
```
$ kubectl get all
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/admin-server-1238998015-f932w   1/1       Running   0          11m

```

#### 4.2 Check PV and PVC
```
$ kubectl get pv
NAME      CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM                    STORAGECLASS   REASON    AGE
pv1       10Gi       RWX           Recycle         Available                            manual                   17m
pv2       10Gi       RWX           Recycle         Bound       default/wlserver-pvc-1   manual                   17m
pv3       10Gi       RWX           Recycle         Bound       default/wlserver-pvc-2   manual                   17m

$ kubectl get pvc
NAME             STATUS    VOLUME    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
wlserver-pvc-1   Bound     pv2       10Gi       RWX           manual         18m
wlserver-pvc-2   Bound     pv3       10Gi       RWX           manual         18m
```
We have three pv defined and two pvc defined. One pv is reserved for later use.

#### 4.3 Check Secrets
```
$ kubectl get secrets
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA      AGE
default-token-m93m1   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3         39d
wlsecret              Opaque                                2         19m
```

### 5. Check Weblogic Server Status via Administrator Console
The admin console URL is 'http://[hostIP]:30007/console' and the user/pwd are weblogic/weblogic1.

### 6. Troubleshooting
You can trace WebLogic server output and logs for troubleshooting.
Trace WebLogic server output. Note you need to replace $serverPod with the actual pod name of a WebLogic server.
```
$ kubectl logs -f $serverPod
```
You can look at the WebLogic server logs by running:
```
$ kubectl exec managed-server-0 -- tail -f /u01/wlsdomain/servers/managed-server-0/logs/managed-server-0.log
$ kubectl exec managed-server-0 -- tail -f /u01/wlsdomain/servers/managed-server-1/logs/managed-server-1.log
$ kubectl exec managed-server-0 -- tail -f /u01/wlsdomain/servers/AdminServer/logs/AdminServer.log
```

### 7. Restart All Pods
#### 7.1 Shutdown the Managed Servers' Pods Gracefully
```
$ kubectl exec -it managed-server-0 -- /u01/wlsdomain/bin/stopManagedWebLogic.sh managed-server-0 t3://admin-server:8001
$ kubectl exec -it managed-server-1 -- /u01/wlsdomain/bin/stopManagedWebLogic.sh managed-server-1 t3://admin-server:8001
```
#### 7.2 Shutdown the Administrator Server Pod Gracefully
First gracefully shutdown admin server process. Note that you need to replace $adminPod with the real admin server pod name.
```
$ kubectl exec -it $adminPod -- /u01/wlsdomain/bin/stopWebLogic.sh weblogic weblogic1 t3://localhost:8001
```
Next manually delete the admin pod.
```
$ kubectl delete pod/$adminPod
```
After the pods are stopped, each pod's corresponding controller is responsible for restarting the pods automatically.
Wait until all pods are running and ready again. Monitor status of pods via `kubectl get pod`.

### 8. Cleanup
```
$ kubectl delete -f k8s/wls-stateful.yml
$ kubectl delete -f k8s/wls-admin.yml
$ kubectl delete -f k8s/pvc.yml
$ kubectl delete -f k8s/pv.yml
$ kubectl delete -f k8s/secrets.yml
```
Or you can cleanup your environment by running clean.sh directly.
Next clean up all data in volume directories via `rm -rf *`.
